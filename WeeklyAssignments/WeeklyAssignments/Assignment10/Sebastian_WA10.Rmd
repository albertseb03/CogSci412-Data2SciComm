# Introduction

Comparing proportions is sometimes very hard! But, even infants seem to be able to do it a little bit. The purpose of this science project was better understand how well people compare proportions when the proportions are prevented in different formats. the purpose of this class assignment is to take the R-code and plots we've been generating over the last several weeks and put it all together into one poster format.

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(c('posterdown', 'rmarkdown','pagedown'), 'packages.bib')
```

## Objectives

1. Does average performance vary across format type?
2. Does average performance vary across numerator congruency status?
3. Does numerator congruency vary across format type? (i.e., is there an interaction)

# Participants

```{r}
num_participants <- 99
```

A total of `r num_participants` adults participated in the study.

# Methods

First, participants were introduced to a story about a magic ball and that the outcome (i.e., blue or orange) depended on the proportions. They were then asked to compare the proportions of different images.

In other words, participants were shown two images of the same kind at the same time and asked to decide which had a higher proportion of the shape (or dots) colored in blue.

</div>
<br>


Conditions

There were four different conditions that changed what kindsof images the participants saw:

-divided blobs: blue and orange were entirely separate

-integrated blob: one blob, divided to be part blue and part orange

-separated dots: blue and orange dots were on opposite sides of the image

-integrated dots: blue and orange dots were intermixed

# Results
```{r, echo=FALSE}
prob_data <- prob_data %>%
  mutate(condition = recode(condition, 
                            "blob_stacked" = "Integrated Blob", 
                            "blob_shifted" = "Divided Blobs",
                            "dots_EqSizeRand"="Integrated Dots",
                            "dots_EqSizeSep"="Separated Dots"))

```


1. Does average performance vary across format type, ignoring all other aspects of the stimuli?

```{r, echo=FALSE}

summarized_data <- prob_data %>%
  group_by(SubID, condition) %>%
  summarise(prop_corr = mean(correct), .groups = "drop")

# Calculate mean and standard error of proportion correct for each condition
plot_data <- summarized_data %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_prop_corr = mean(prop_corr),
    se_prop_corr = sd(prop_corr) / sqrt(n())
  )

ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = condition, y = mean_prop_corr)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 3) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_prop_corr - se_prop_corr, ymax = mean_prop_corr + se_prop_corr), 
                width = 0.2, color = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Condition", y = "Mean Proportion Correct", title = "Proportion Correct by Condition") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1), expand = c(0, 0))


```

Participants' average performance was at its best with the integrated blob and dots and was at its worst with the separated/divided blobs and dots.


2. How are reaction time and accuracy related?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary_data <- prob_data %>%
  group_by(SubID, condition) %>%
  summarise(
    rt = mean(rt, na.rm = TRUE),
    correct = mean(correct, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()


ggplot(summary_data, aes(x = rt, y = correct)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "darkblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Reaction Time vs. Accuracy by Condition",
    x = "Reaction Time (ms)",
    y = "Proportion Correct"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~ condition) +
  theme_minimal()
```
Generally speaking, for all conditions, as reaction  time increases, accuracy increases as well

3. How does numerator congruency interact with format type?


```{r, echo=FALSE}
prob_data_mod <- prob_data %>%
  # a. Separate `left_stim` into `left_numerator` and `left_other`
  separate(left_stim, into = c("left_numerator", "left_other"), sep = "_", convert = TRUE) %>%
  
  # b. Separate `right_stim` into `right_numerator` and `right_other`
  separate(right_stim, into = c("right_numerator", "right_other"), sep = "_", convert = TRUE) %>%
  
  # c. Calculate `left_proportion_value` and `right_proportion_value`
  mutate(
    left_proportion_value = left_numerator / (left_numerator + left_other),
    right_proportion_value = right_numerator / (right_numerator + right_other)
  ) %>%
  
  # d. Create `larger_numerator` column
  mutate(
    larger_numerator = if_else(left_numerator > right_numerator, "left", "right")
  ) %>%
  
  # e. Create `larger_proportion` column
  mutate(
    larger_proportion = if_else(left_proportion_value > right_proportion_value, "left", "right")
  ) %>%
  
  # f. Create `num_congruent` column
  mutate(
    num_congruent = (larger_numerator == larger_proportion)
  )

summary_data <- prob_data_mod %>%
  group_by(SubID, condition, num_congruent) %>%
  summarize(proportion_correct = mean(correct, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(summary_data, aes(x = condition, y = proportion_correct, color = num_congruent)) +
  stat_halfeye(
    aes(fill = num_congruent),
    adjust = 0.5,
    width = 0.6,
    justification = -0.1,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.8) # Adjust position
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Condition",
    y = "Proportion Correct",
    color = "Numerator Congruency",
    fill = "Numerator Congruency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "right",
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  ) +
  ggtitle("Proportion Correct by Condition and Numerator Congruency")

```
When there is a numerator congruency, the proportion correct across all format types is higher than when there is not.


# Conclusion

1. The most annoying part of this assignment was integrating the old plots into this poster and having to make the adjustments in order to make them "publication" ready

2. The most satisfying part of this assignment is when you make aesthetic changes on the file and then rendering it to see how much better it makes the poster.
