	abstract = {The dangerous chemical hydrogen fluoride sits at the apex of the fluorochemical industry, but the substantial hazards linked to its production under harsh conditions (above 300 degrees Celsius) and transport are typically contracted to specialists. All fluorochemicals for applications, including refrigeration, electric transportation, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, are prepared from fluorspar (CaF2) through a procedure that generates highly dangerous hydrogen fluoride1–5. Here we report a mild method to obtain fluorochemicals directly from fluorspar, bypassing the necessity to manufacture hydrogen fluoride. Acid-grade fluorspar (more than 97 per cent CaF2) is treated with the fluorophilic Lewis acid boric acid (B(OH)3) or silicon dioxide (SiO2), in the presence of oxalic acid, a Brønsted acid that is highly effective for Ca2+ sequestration. This scalable process carried out in water at low temperature (below 50 degrees Celsius) enables access to widely used fluorochemicals, including tetrafluoroboric acid, alkali metal fluorides, tetraalkylammonium fluorides and fluoro(hetero)arenes. The replacement of oxalic acid with sulfuric acid gave comparable results for B(OH)3, but was not as effective when the fluorophilic Lewis acid was SiO2. A similar process also works with the lower-purity metspar. The production of fluorochemicals directly from fluorspar offers the possibility of decentralized manufacturing—an attractive model for the fluorochemical industry. With the renewed interest in innovative methods to synthesize oxalic acid via carbon dioxide capture and biomass6,7, and the challenges posed by our dependence on fossil fuels for sulfur and therefore sulfuric acid supply8,9, our technology may represent a departure towards a sustainable fluorochemical industry.},

	abstract = {A critical challenge in glioma treatment is detecting tumour infiltration during surgery to achieve safe maximal resection1–3. Unfortunately, safely resectable residual tumour is found in the majority of patients with glioma after surgery, causing early recurrence and decreased survival4–6. Here we present FastGlioma, a visual foundation model for fast ({\textless}10 s) and accurate detection of glioma infiltration in fresh, unprocessed surgical tissue. FastGlioma was pretrained using large-scale self-supervision (around 4 million images) on rapid, label-free optical microscopy, and fine-tuned to output a normalized score that indicates the degree of tumour infiltration within whole-slide optical images. In a prospective, multicentre, international testing cohort of patients with diffuse glioma (n = 220), FastGlioma was able to detect and quantify the degree of tumour infiltration with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 92.1 ± 0.9\%. FastGlioma outperformed image-guided and fluorescence-guided adjuncts for detecting tumour infiltration during surgery by a wide margin in a head-to-head, prospective study (n = 129). The performance of FastGlioma remained high across diverse patient demographics, medical centres and diffuse glioma molecular subtypes as defined by the World Health Organization. FastGlioma shows zero-shot generalization to other adult and paediatric brain tumour diagnoses, demonstrating the potential for our foundation model to be used as a general-purpose adjunct for guiding brain tumour surgeries. These findings represent the transformative potential of medical foundation models to unlock the role of artificial intelligence in the care of patients with cancer.},

	abstract = {The ionosphere is a layer of weakly ionized plasma bathed in Earth’s geomagnetic field extending about 50–1,500 kilometres above Earth1. The ionospheric total electron content varies in response to Earth’s space environment, interfering with Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) signals, resulting in one of the largest sources of error for position, navigation and timing services2. Networks of high-quality ground-based GNSS stations provide maps of ionospheric total electron content to correct these errors, but large spatiotemporal gaps in data from these stations mean that these maps may contain errors3. Here we demonstrate that a distributed network of noisy sensors—in the form of millions of Android phones—can fill in many of these gaps and double the measurement coverage, providing an accurate picture of the ionosphere in areas of the world underserved by conventional infrastructure. Using smartphone measurements, we resolve features such as plasma bubbles over India and South America, solar-storm-enhanced density over North America and a mid-latitude ionospheric trough over Europe. We also show that the resulting ionosphere maps can improve location accuracy, which is our primary aim. This work demonstrates the potential of using a large distributed network of smartphones as a powerful scientific instrument for monitoring Earth.},
