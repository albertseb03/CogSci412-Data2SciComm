# ICMA 9/11/2024

Variable names cannot have special symbols
Error: 0hno!This_is.a_nightmare <- "hello"
Fixed: message<- "hello"

2+2 in console: Output shows up in console window
2+2 in a  chunk: Output shows up right below the  chunk

x <- 2 + 2 in a code chunk: No output
y <- 2 + 2 in console: No output
In environment pane, x and y are loisted as variables with values of 4

?mean: R displays a help page for the mean function
help(mean): Same output as ?mean

```{r}
data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
result <- sd(data)
print(result)
```
# ICMA 9/16/2024

```{r}
my_numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10)
mean_value <- mean(my_numbers)
print(mean_value)
mean_value_pipe <- my_numbers %>% mean()
print(mean_value_pipe)
```
The two outputs are the same

```{r}
?mtcars
write_csv(mtcars, "mtcars_fromR.csv")
read_csv("mtcars_fromR.csv")
```
Everything appears as expected with no missing values or empty columns/rows

  select(chick_id = Chick, 
         diet = Diet,
         age_days = Time, 
         weight_gm = weight)%>%  ## renaming & re-ordering while keeping
  mutate(weight_lb = weight_gm / 453.6)  # Creating a new column for weight in pounds

# Create a summary table for Day 20
summary_table <- chick_clean %>%
  filter(age_days == 20) %>%  # Filter for Day 20
  group_by(diet) %>%  # Group by diet
  summarise(
    num_chicks = n(),  # Count of chicks
    avg_weight_gm = mean(weight_gm, na.rm = TRUE),  # Average weight in grams
    avg_weight_lb = mean(weight_lb, na.rm = TRUE)  # Average weight in pounds

```{r}
long_billboard <- billboard %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"),
    names_to = "week",
    names_pattern = "wk(\\d+)",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>%
  mutate(value = replace_na(value, 0))  # Replace NAs with 0

```
In pivot_longer(), missing values from the wide form will appear as NA in the long form by default. To change how these are represented, I first reshaped the data and then used the replace_na() function from the dplyr package to fill in the missing values.

```{r}
library(lubridate)
long_billboard <- long_billboard %>%
  rename(date = "date.entered")  

long_billboard <- long_billboard %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(as.character(date))) %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("Year", "Month", "Day"), sep = "-")
```

# ICMA 11/04/2024

Format:beamer_presentation

1.New Slide: Add --- on a new line to start a new slide.

2.Bullets (Incremental): Use - or * for bullets. Set incremental: true in the YAML header to make bullets appear one at a time. You can also use \pause between bullets on specific slides.


3.Aesthetic Features (Font, Background, Colors):

Font: Add \usepackage{helvet} and \renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault} in the YAML for Helvetica or sans-serif fonts.
Background Color: Use \setbeamercolor{background canvas}{bg=color_name} in the YAML.
Theme and Color Options: Set theme: "Madrid" and colortheme: "dolphin" under output: beamer_presentation in the YAML.


4.Inserting Plots, Images, Tables:

Plots: Use a code chunk, e.g., {r} plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg).
Images: Use {r} knitr::include_graphics("path/to/image.png").
Tables: Use kable or gt, e.g., {r} kable(head(mtcars)).
